This is an app which provides the survey details of employees. There is two section which is used i..e Survey List and Assigned Survey.
Survey List shows the list of all survey which is available right now and not yet taken by you. If you click add on Survey from Survey list then it will add survey into Assigned Survey list and remove it from survey list. In the same way we can remove survey from assigned survey by clicking on remove button and since this survey is not in your assigned list , it will appear on Survey List.
